    <center><p> Mark Basehore and James McConnell joined forces with two Brooklynites to open MOTHER, a gastropub concept located at 447 Edgewood Ave. We worked with artist Matt Relkin and The Woods restaurateur Jason Radich, Mark and James had a vision to transform the 130-year-old brownstone building down the street from Sister Louisa's Church into a spacious bar and restaurant complete with patio seating. We came together and brainstormed this great idea for this awesome venue while frequenting this amazing block. My brother and I use to own and run " Beep Beep Gallery", just down the road from here it was a tiny, tiny space features cutting-edge work by a great mix of young, emerging artists with smaller pieces cleverly stored in old record crates. The exhibition openings - often with live music - were like house parties and we loved the idea of enteraining our art community friends and along the way we've met alot of other rad people but we knew we needed a bigger venue to host these dope parties where our friends along with our new friends could come together and have a great time. How we came about the name "Mom", well that was easy, who doesn't love there mothers, and with a sense your "Mom", would be watching over you hahaha. Why "Edgewood"? Well the neighborhood is incrediable, the people are amazing, and a few of the places we frequent are dope spots on the block. This is our scene and we wanted to share a visual piece of us with this city.   </p></center>
